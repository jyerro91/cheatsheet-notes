## Module 5 - Technical Analysis
---

## What is Technical Analysis

- Involves the study of price action through chart patterns and indicators that follow the price movements of a stock or group of stocks (indices) or coins
- Gives an understanding of market sentimenets characterized by the cumulative emotions of buyers and sellers at certain periods of time
- Provides a benchmark or historical perspective to any stock or sector or market at certain timeframes (minute, hourly, daily ...)
- is not about predicting with certainty but to identify high probability outcomes


## Reading candlestick charts
#### Candlestick

- The price evoluition is more important than what can explain it 
- All known information is reflected in the price
- PUrchasers and Sellers act according to their expectations and their emotions
- Markets may have fluctuations but overall trend should be identifiable
- Prices does not reflect the underlying value of firms

#### Reading candle stick


## Support and Resistance Strategy

- Only `Buy` on an Uptrend or a Sideways Trend
- Only `Buy` on dips on confirmation candle bouncing from Support lines
- Be patient and only buy on confirmation candle signal
- `Sell` before reaching or upon touching Resistance line
- However if there is unusually high volume upon reaching Resistance, you can wait if the price will break out

## Breakout Strategy

- Wait for a confirmation candle to breakout of a known Resistance line
- Prison break - the confirmation candle's body (open and close price) must be fully out of the Resistance line
- Breakout should be supported by strong volume
- Buy on the 2nd candle above the Resistance line


## Indicator

#### Momentum Indicators

- RSI
- CCI
- Stochastics

#### Trend Following Indicators

- Exponential Moving Average 
  - Length 9 & 20 (When using Mobile)
  - Length 9 (when using PC)
- MACD
  - Length 9
- Smooth Moving Average (SMA) 

#### Volatility Indicators

- Bolinger Bands (BB)
  - length 50                                                                                                                                             


#### Volume Indicators

**Combination of Indicator**

- TF + Momentum 
  - EMA
  - RSI
  - VOLUME
- TF + Volume
  - 

- Volatility + Momentum
  - 


#### Rule 2

If you are using TF < 15 mins
EMA max of 20 length
RSI 14 (optional 30), RSI can be 10

If you are using >1 hour
RSI 30 (rsi 14 optional)
EMA 20+50 (optional 100 and 200)
BB 50



## Module 5 - Technical Analysis 202

#### Laggard Metrics

**Candlesticks/Charts**

- Study of Price, Volume and Trends
- Study of Chart patterns
- Study of price action in different time frames

**Volatility and TF**

- Studies placed over charts to further analyze price patterns and behaviors
- Examples are MA and BB

**Momentum**

- Studies placed at the bottom ofo charts to aid in the analysis and decision making process
- Examples are MACD, RSI, Stochastics aka Oscillators

**The Overlays We Normally Use**

- MA
- Parabolic SAR
- Bollinger Bands
- Volume

#### Exponential Moving Averages (*EMA*)

Reduce the lag by applying more weight to recent prices. The weighting applied to the most recent price depends on the number of periods in the moving average.

*Configuration*

`20 EMA`

- 20-Day average 
- PRices crossing this EMA line (20/50) normally change trends
- **Used for Short Term Trends**

`50 EMA`

- 50-day average price
- Prices crossing this EMA line confirms the trend
- **Used for both short and medium term trends**

`100 EMA`

- Prices and EMA (40/100) crossing this line indicated reversal of trends
- **Used to indicate medium and longer term trend changes**

#### Parabolic SAR

The Parabolic SAR (Stop and Return) is a trading system devised by Welles Wilder that looks for changes in price trends.

It is a technical indicator used to determine the price direction of an asset, as well draw attention to when the price direction is changing.

When you apply this overlay to a chart, the first SAR point appears at the end of the previous price trend. From thereon, in an uptrend, new points are plotted as the price makes new highs.

In the case of an uptrend, the Parabolic SAR line appears underneath the price line. But in a downtrend, the SAR line is above price line.

Partner: `MACD`

#### Bollinger Bands

Are overlay channels t hat are drawn using a stock's MA and the standard deviation from that Moving Average

They consist of three bands, with the following defaults settings:

- A middle band (plotted using a stocks 20-day moving average)
- A lower band (plotted 2 standard deviations below the moving average)
- An upper band (plotted 2 standard deviations above the moving average)

The lower and upper bands can be used to identify levels of support and resistance in price.

*Usage*

- To indentify trend continuation or reversal
- To identify overbought or oversold levels
- To anticipate Breakouts or breakdowns

#### Volume Price Analysis (*VPA*)

- Compares and analyses price behavior agains associated volume
- Comparing volume to judge strenth/weakness of price behavior in the context of volume history
- VPA only looks at 2 things: whether the price is validated by volume or whether there is an anomaly
- Price validation confirms continuation of price behavior
- Price anomaly signals a potential change


#### MACD

Traders use the MACD for determining trend direction, momentum and potential reversals. It is used to confirm trades based on other strategies, but it also provides its own trade signals.

There are 3 components on the MACD indicator:

1. The MACD line (blue line)
2. The signal line (red line moves slower as the Signal line is a moving average of the MACD line)
3. Historgram

The MACD Line and the Signal lines normally criss cross each other at certain timeframes and is used to identify trend reversals. The MACD histogram oscillates above and below zero shows the extent to which the MACD line is above or below signal line. The histogram provides a short-term view on recent momentum and direction.


#### Stoch

*Configuration*


15, 1, 3

#### Commodity Channel Index

Developed by Donald Lambert, the CCI is a momentum-based oscillator used to help determine when an investment vehicle is reaching a condition of being overbought or oversold.

It is also used to asses price trend direction and strength. This information allows traders to determine if they want to enter or exit a trade, refrain from taking a trade, or add to an existing position. In this way, the indicator can be used to provide trade signals when it acts in a certain way
