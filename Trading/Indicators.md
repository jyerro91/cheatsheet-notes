# Indicators

## MACD

- Traders use the MACD for determining trend direction, momentum and potential reversals. it is used to confirm trades based on other strategies, but it also provides its own trade signals.
- There are 3 components on the MACD indicator:

1. The MACD line (blue line)
2. The Signal Line (red line moves slower as the Signal line is a moving average of the MACD line)
3. Histogram

## RSI (Relative Strength Index)

- The RSI is an indicator that moves back and forth between 0 and 100, providing insight into the underlying strength or weakness of stock prices. It is used in various capacities, including confirming trends, providing trade signals and foreshadowing reversals.
- The RSI moves higher when the average gains over a period, typically 14 days, are larger than the average losesses. The indicator moves down when the averages losesses are greater than average gains
- Put another way, if the indicator is at 100, over the last 14 days it was all gains. If the indicator is at zero, all 14 periods were losses.
- the stock is said to be `Oversold` (Buy signal) is when the line is below 30 and `Overbought` (Sell signal) is when the line is above 70

When crosses 70 it is called `parabolic RSI` and sell in 78 or 80.

`Configuration: 70/30`

### RSI in Action - Divergence

- `Bearish` divergence is when the price is making new highs, but the RSI isn't. It shows that momentum has slowed, and a reversal could be forthcoming.
- `Bullish` divergence is when the price is making new lows, but the RSI isn't. It shows selling pressure has slowed and a reversal could be around the corner.

> Like MACD, Signal line crossovers provide better timing of entry and exit points. the default signal lines are at 70 and 30 levels

> With this method, a `BUY` signal occurs when the RSI line crosses above the 30 signal line while a `SELL` signal occurs when the RSI line crosses below the 70 line.
