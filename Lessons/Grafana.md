## Metrics 101

metrics represent the raw measurements of resource usage or behavior that can be observed and collected throughout your systems

##### common metrics
> Some really common metrics which you'd like to look at are system metrics such as CPU, Memory, Disk space. Then you can monitor higher level metrics such as Incoming HTTP requests to your server, latency, API error rates.

##### what metrics to use?
> I think on top of the basic metrics such as CPU, Memory, Disk etc. you have to answer the question: "What metrics are important so that my users are able to use my software and my business is succesful?", "What system failures can impact my customer?". Those answer can vary. You may end up measuring TCP connections or Number of sales per hour.
