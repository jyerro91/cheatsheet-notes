### Introduction

#### Why?

Communication is much more than just words. We communicate through our verbal as well as our non-verbal behaviour. Various factors, such as emotions and relations, play a big part in our everyday interactions and communication with others.

Being conscious of our own communication preferences, how they affect others, as well as being aware of the four different levels of communications can provide us with the tools to start communication more consciously. As a leader, this knowledge is very helpful also in our communication and interaction with our team members.

#### How?

Since effective communication does not come naturally to everyone, we will look at how we communicate and how we can avoid miscommunication.

We will learn the different levels of communication and practice how to switch between them as well as aligning verbal and nonverbal communication in order to ensure that our message comes across the way we intend it to.

#### What?

The four levels of communication in the 'Switchbox model' act as a framework to describe how we communicate. This model not only helps us to make ourselves more understandable, it also helps us to understand others better.

Changing how we communicate to match someone else can be the key to a successful interaction.

Let us dive into the 'Switchbox model' and learn more about how to recognise and adapt to the different levels.

### Different communication levels

**Content level**

The Content level deals with the subject of what is being discussed. It is about the topic of the conversation and may concern the who, what, when or how of what someone is saying. When you talk about the facts, figures, and objectives, you are talking on content level. 

> [!example] 
> going through the numbers of this quarter and whether you hit the targets is all content level communication.

**Procedural level**

The Procedural level represents schedules, rules, and planning of the conversation you are in.

> [!example] 
> going through the meeting's agenda and agreeing on who will be presenting falls under the procedural level.

**Relational level**

The Relational level refers to how you interact with one another. Patterns of communication, the atmosphere and power dynamics, are all part of this level. 

> [!example] 
> when someone who is leading a meeting decides to move on to the next topic on the agenda, he/she is using his/her power dynamic. If you also notice non-verbal signals from your colleagues, like them checking their watches or sighing impatiently, this will affect the atmosphere and you might, in turn, feel pressured to start talking faster.

**Emotional level**

The Emotional level deals with feelings and emotions which may arise during conversations. Emotions are a result of our personal thoughts, beliefs, and opinions which then translate through emotions such as anger, sadness, or happiness.

> They are typically easy to recognise through visible acts, such as raising your voice, crying, and laughing. However, emotions can also be disguised by cynicism, sarcasm, or humour which might give you the wrong impression of someone’s true emotions.


### Intervention on the four levels

1. Summarising what has been said
2. Giving an overview and order of what has already been said
