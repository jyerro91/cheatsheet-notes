## Lead the conversation
---

### Introduction

#### Why?

Communication is much more than just words. We communicate through our verbal as well as our non-verbal behaviour. Various factors, such as emotions and relations, play a big part in our everyday interactions and communication with others.

Being conscious of our own communication preferences, how they affect others, as well as being aware of the four different levels of communications can provide us with the tools to start communication more consciously. As a leader, this knowledge is very helpful also in our communication and interaction with our team members.

#### How?

Since effective communication does not come naturally to everyone, we will look at how we communicate and how we can avoid miscommunication.

We will learn the different levels of communication and practice how to switch between them as well as aligning verbal and nonverbal communication in order to ensure that our message comes across the way we intend it to.

#### What?

The four levels of communication in the 'Switchbox model' act as a framework to describe how we communicate. This model not only helps us to make ourselves more understandable, it also helps us to understand others better.

Changing how we communicate to match someone else can be the key to a successful interaction.

Let us dive into the 'Switchbox model' and learn more about how to recognise and adapt to the different levels.

### Different communication levels

**Content level**

The Content level deals with the subject of what is being discussed. It is about the topic of the conversation and may concern the who, what, when or how of what someone is saying. When you talk about the facts, figures, and objectives, you are talking on content level. 

> [!example] 
> going through the numbers of this quarter and whether you hit the targets is all content level communication.

**Procedural level**

The Procedural level represents schedules, rules, and planning of the conversation you are in.

> [!example] 
> going through the meeting's agenda and agreeing on who will be presenting falls under the procedural level.

**Relational level**

The Relational level refers to how you interact with one another. Patterns of communication, the atmosphere and power dynamics, are all part of this level. 

> [!example] 
> when someone who is leading a meeting decides to move on to the next topic on the agenda, he/she is using his/her power dynamic. If you also notice non-verbal signals from your colleagues, like them checking their watches or sighing impatiently, this will affect the atmosphere and you might, in turn, feel pressured to start talking faster.

**Emotional level**

The Emotional level deals with feelings and emotions which may arise during conversations. Emotions are a result of our personal thoughts, beliefs, and opinions which then translate through emotions such as anger, sadness, or happiness. 

> [!abstract] 
> They are typically easy to recognise through visible acts, such as raising your voice, crying, and laughing. However, emotions can also be disguised by cynicism, sarcasm, or humour which might give you the wrong impression of someone’s true emotions.


### Intervention on the four levels

**Content**

1. Summarising what has been said
2. Giving an overview and order of what has already been said
3. Pointing out what falls in the discussion and what is off-topic
4. Adding something to the discussed topic
5. Explaining or requesting more information about the subject
6. Testing whether something is well understood
7. Suggesting solutions or proposals for actions
   
**Procedural**

1. Discussing the agenda for the meeting
2. Discussing the goal/ the desired outcome of the conversation
3. Discussing roles; who does what?
4. Discussing time agreements
5. Discussing the approach to an agenda item or working method
6. Ensuring that the procedure is accepted by other people involved
7. Monitoring the procedure
8. Changing the procedure if it does not work
   
**Relational**

1. Describing a pattern you notice in the conversation
2. Asking for feedback on your own behavior in a discussion 
3. Making a comment about the atmosphere in a meeting
4. Sharing that you notice a pattern in a conversation
5. Commenting on how/if people are working together in the conversation 
6. Signaling a possible blockage in communication

**Emotional**

1. Expressing your feelings at this moment in the conversation
2. Asking how the other person feels about what is happening now
3. Saying what the questions or comments from others do to you
4. Asking how the last comment makes them feel
5. Testing whether the others feel safe to discuss a point now

## Listen with presence
---

**Fixing**  
While listening to someone share their situation, I thought about how to solve their problem, giving them potential solutions that may fix their situation. E.g. _‘Hey, have you tried ...’_

  
**Correcting**  
While listening to someone, I corrected what they were saying. I focused on when they were wrong or gave them points of improvement or criticism.

  
**Befriending**  
While listening to someone, I did so with the intention of befriending them. I tried to find out what I could say or how I could say certain things to make sure that they would like me.

  
**Comforting**  
While listening to someone, I primarily focused on comforting them rather than their actual message. I was trying to find out how they want to be taken care of and then responding to them making really sure that they know that I care for them and am there to comfort them.

  
**Avoiding Conflict**  
While listening to someone, I avoided interacting more in depth due to possible conflict. I stepped back from the conversation as much as possible and responded silently with smiles and nods.

  
**Multi-tasking**  
While listening to someone, I tried to fit them in between doing other stuff, either by multi-tasking while they were talking or thinking about other things while they talk. I answered with small gestures like nodding or comments such as _‘I’m listening, continue’._

  
**Knowing**  
While listening to someone, I felt like I already knew what they were talking about and had thoughts like _‘I already know this’_ or _‘Tell me something I don't know’ going through my head'._

  
**Debating**  
While listening to someone, I played the devil’s advocate. I started debates on whatever they said and was sceptical of their message.

  
**Selecting**  
While listening to someone, I focused only on the parts that excited me and dismissed everything else that was not part of my selection. E.g. _‘That second point is really exciting, how about…’_

  
**Defending**  
While listening to someone, I defended the situation they described, regardless of my own point of view, by explaining how they may have misperceived it and then reframing the situation for them. E.g. _‘There’s a probably a good reason for them to react that way’_ or _‘Maybe there is more to it than you know.’_

  
**Self-Referencing**  
While listening to someone, I tried to relate what they were saying to myself. I attempted to connect or make their experience fit similar experiences I’ve had and referenced how the two things are similar.

## Navigate challenging conversations
---

**LETTING IT REST**

- When the issue is unimportant or does not have consequences for your goal
- When other goals or issues are more important for you and your therefore do not want to get too much involved in this one
- When you need to let people cool down to have a more productive, open-minded and less emotionally charged conversation at a later point in time
- When you still want to gather more information before discussing this topic
- When others are better suited to navigate this challenging conversation as they are i.e. less emotionally involved, have more expertise, etc.

**STANDING YOUR GROUND**

- In case of emergencies when a quick, effective decision has to be made
- When your goals are unpopular but important, such as cost cutting, or  
    implementation of rules
- When your goal is important for ING, such as its financial position, or public image
- When you are the expert on the topic

**INVESTING IN WIN-WIN**

- When you are aiming for an integrative and creative solution/idea
- When the goals of both parties are too important to them to ‘find the middle ground’, yet you want to have everyone on board
- When the goal is to learn, merge knowledge and/or insights from different people

Note: ‘Investing in win-win’ requires a high degree of trust, time and effort.

**FOLLOWING THE OTHER**

- When the other party is the expert
- When the goal/issue is more important to the other person than to you
- When harmony and remaining a good working relationship is very important
- When you want to allow people to experiment and learn from their mistakes

**FINDING THE MIDDLE GROUND**

- When the goals of both parties are important to them, yet not worth damaging the working relationship
- When you have equal power but completely different goals
- When you need a temporary solution
- When ‘investing in win-win’ or ‘standing your ground’ fails, a ‘finding the middle ground’ alignment style can be used as backup

Be careful: ‘Finding the middle ground’ is often seen as an ‘easy way out’, but it is not a long term solution since neither party really gets what they want.

## Protect your time
---

### Three Time Killers
- self
- technology
- something

### Self
Losing precious time does not always have an external cause: your thoughts and behaviour can be a reason for losing time. The ‘Self’ category covered having smart task lists, tackling procrastination and avoiding multi-tasking.

- Smark task lists
> Try to choose as few systems (on/offline) as possible, where you gather all your to do’s. Make sure each to-do is clearly formulated and has a deadline and estimate on time. Additionally, you can label your to do’s, group them into bigger projects and use different colours for different work areas.

- Procastination
> Plan to 'eat your frog' (the task that you are dreading) first thing in the morning: get the worst out of your way.

- Multi-tasking
>It is a myth. Just because you can, does not mean you are being as efficient as you think you are or intend to be.

  
### Technology
Technology has made it more difficult than ever not to get distracted. The ‘Technology’ category covered how to handle continuous messages and marking your time effectively.

- **Continuous messages** - Being available 24/7 and responsive can be your downfall and consume a lot of your time. Choose who you want to receive notifications from, use your profile status, make sure you are only in relevant group chats and treat chats like emails (pick a time and place to answer them). 

- **Mark your time** - Make sure to set rules for you and your team to optimize the time you have within a day. Block time for deep work sessions, use a time tracking application to see where you spend your time on and define an urgency rule within the team to highlight when something is really important. And are you on holiday? Disconnect and replace your work apps with mindfulness ones!

### Interaction with others
Not only you but also others can be distracted. The ‘Interaction with others’ category covered how to deal with others distracting you and how to handle last-minute requests.

#### Last minute urgent requests

*Step 1*

**First of all, it is imperative to ensure you truly understand the request made to you.**

- You might be filling in the blanks already, when someone starts to explain what they need help with.
- You may end up anticipating more, or on the contrary, less work than the actual request entails. So, listen; make sure you really understand what is being asked.

*Step 2*

**Be clear on the extent to which you can/want to accept the request.**

Communication is key here. Be open in your communication and completely transparent in what you can/cannot do. A good tip is to start with 'Yes, if..' or 'No, unless..' to already lay out what is possible. E.g.

- 'Yes, if we can postpone the deadline to tomorrow afternoon.'
- 'Of course, if you can plan in an hour to walk me through the information beforehand.'
- 'Definitely, if you lead the meeting, I can be there to support from my area of expertise.'
- 'No, unless it has a higher priority than project 'X'.'
- 'I do not think so, unless you can support me with resources on this task today.'
- 'I am not sure that will be possible, unless it can wait until the end of the day.'

*Step 3*

**Explain why. Share the potential effect of a 'yes' on your agenda, and other priorities.**

This is not about listing everything that will happen because of the request made to push the person in front of you away. Instead, it is again about being transparent on what the consequences will be.

  
Current projects may be affected; is this acceptable? Other priorities may be pushed which affect X number of people; is the request still more important than project 'X'?

  
By being clear on the consequences, both directly towards you but also towards others it can help put the request into perspective and make it debatable on whether or not it is as urgent as proposed.

*Step 4*

**Think of creative solutions & alternatives and/or give explicit conditions.**

Finally, it is time to decide on the solution.

Be creative, think outside the box and if need be, discuss alternatives. E.g. maybe someone in a similar role can be of support.

And lastly, be explicitly detailed when it comes to the conditions. If you, for example, agree to follow along to a meeting but not lead, be explicit on this so that there is no confusion in the meeting itself.

*Summary:* 

- **Distraction by others** - Direct when and where your time is used! Find a quiet space where you can sit to focus, cluster your answers to questions, let others know what times you are available for questions and stand up from your desk if someone comes to you with a request.

- **Last-minute urgent requests** - When an urgent request comes up it is important to get aligned on the task at hand. Make sure you understand what it means to accept this request, share the potential consequence it has on your agenda/ other priorities and be clear on the extent you can/want to accept the request. Are you thinking about saying yes? Give explicit conditions. Are you thinking about saying no? Think of creative solutions and alternatives.

## Use the ‘Never say no’ mode

**Your mission**  
This week whenever someone gives you/your team a task, take a moment to run through the ‘Never say no’ model. Start by clarifying what the task that is requested entails. When you got the first step under control, add on the second and so on.

  
**Examples**  
_‘Could you check this document and send me your ideas?'_  
_‘So, you want me to read this document, think of ideas and send you 5 concrete_ _suggestions in a document?'_

  
**Why**  
Rephrasing a task and giving more detail to the request helps clarify, to both you and the requester, how much work the task actually entails. It can help identify vagueness in the initial request and by having more information it will be easier to prioritise and plan.
